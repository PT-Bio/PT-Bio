*Hello World!*

This repo is specifically made for PonyTown! If you're not from there, this won't make sense! Also, I'd prefer if this repo wasn't starred, but alas, i can't stop you if you do star it....


--General Info--

-My pronouns are He/Him and It/Its. Please refer to me with them regardless of who my character is.

-I'm very shy, and I'd usually like to be left alone. Nothin' personal, just not a very social guy. Please don't ask or beg me to be your friend.

-I may not respond to crowning or compliments because of said shyness, but please know that I do appreciate it a lot :)

-If my skin is a fictional character, don't go up all like "OMG IT'S [insert character here] FBHJVDNFRUJ" because I'm not the character dude :/ I'm a real ass guy and it's pretty annoying when people do that. *Looks at annoying deltarune fans who freak out about my skin being spamton*

-I feel like I need to emphasise this one: **Do not kiss or flirt with me, ever!** Don't do it if you like the character that my skin is, don't do it in roleplay, just don't do it. No exceptions. It makes me really uncomfortable and I will most likely immediately hide you. Please dude, I just wanna play funny pony game, not be your boyfriend, get outta here

-I'm okay with being invited to parties or roleplays as long as they're not super serious, i like a little bit of trolling in my roleplays :D


--DNI (Do Not Interact)--

-If you're homophobic, transphobic, racist, ableist, all that jazz.

-If you're only talking to start drama over something.

-If you're advertising a roleplay or something

-You're trying to date (listen the amount of times this has happened is huge and it's so weird, it's a pony game bro i don't wanna kiss)

-JJBA fandom and over obsessive DSMP stans (JJBA fans and... *most* anime fans, actually, are just generally annoying is all, that's it lol. DSMP stans, however... yikes no thanks...)

(JJBA = JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, DSMP = Dream SMP)

-People who fake having a "touch trigger" or Haphephobia, Disassociative Identity Disorder, psychosis, any mental illness/disorder really. You're not cool for faking these, and I certainly don't want to talk to you.

-This one is fandom specific, but by god, if you are a DST fan who ships Wendy and Wilson, stay the absolute fuck away from me. I don't think I need to explain why shipping a 30 year old with someone who isn't even 10 yet is really gross.

-People who bash neopronouns


If you start really bugging me, I'll probably just hide you or something. That's what the feature's for, after all!
