*Hello World!*

This repo is specifically made for PonyTown! If you're not from there, this won't make sense! Also, I'd prefer if this repo wasn't starred, but alas, i can't stop you if you do star it.... (it also used to be longer but i cut it in half)


--General Info--

-My pronouns are He/Him! Please refer to me with them regardless of who my character is.

-I'm very shy, and I'd usually like to be left alone. Nothin' personal, just not a very social guy

-If my skin is a fictional character, don't go up all like "OMG IT'S [insert character here] FBHJVDNFRUJ" because I'm not the character dude :/ I'm a real heckin' guy

-Don't kiss/flirt with me. ever. i just wanna play funny pony game, not be your boyfriend, get outta here


--DNI (Do Not Interact)--

-If you're homophobic, transphobic, racist, ableist, all that jazz.

-If you're only talking to start drama over something.

-If you're advertising a roleplay or something

-You're trying to date (listen the amount of times this has happened is huge and it's so weird, it's a pony game bro i don't wanna kiss)


aaand that's pretty much it. not gonna include an interests list because if i did, i'd be here for 2 hours haha
