*Hello World!*

This repo is specifically made for PonyTown! If you're not from there, this won't make sense! Also, I'd prefer if this repo wasn't starred, but alas, i can't stop you if you do star it.... (it also used to be longer but i cut it in half)


--General Info--

-My pronouns are He/Him! I also occassionally use and am comfotable with using It/Its. Please refer to me with them regardless of who my character is.

-I'm very shy, and I'd usually like to be left alone. Nothin' personal, just not a very social guy. Please don't ask or beg me to be your friend.

-I may not respond to crowning or compliments because of said shyness, but please know that I do appreciate it a lot :)

-If my skin is a fictional character, don't go up all like "OMG IT'S [insert character here] FBHJVDNFRUJ" because I'm not the character dude :/ I'm a real ass guy and it's pretty annoying when people do that. *Looks at annoying deltarune fans who freak out about my skin being spamton*

-I feel like I need to emphasise this one: **Do not kiss or flirt with me, ever!** Don't do it if you like the character that my skin is, don't do it in roleplay, just don't do it. No exceptions. It makes me really uncomfortable and I will most likely immediately hide you. Please dude, I just wanna play funny pony game, not be your boyfriend, get outta here

-I'm okay with being invited to parties or roleplays as long as they're not super serious, i like a little bit of trolling in my roleplays :D


--DNI (Do Not Interact)--

-If you're homophobic, transphobic, racist, ableist, all that jazz.

-If you're only talking to start drama over something.

-If you're advertising a roleplay or something

-You're trying to date (listen the amount of times this has happened is huge and it's so weird, it's a pony game bro i don't wanna kiss)

-JJBA fandom and over obsessive DSMP stans (JJBA fans and... *most* anime fans, actually, are just generally annoying is all, that's it lol. DSMP stans, however... yikes no thanks...)

(JJBA = JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, DSMP = Dream SMP)

-People who fake having a "touch trigger" or Haphephobia, Disassociative Identity Disorder, psychosis, any mental illness/disorder really. You're not cool for faking these, and I certainly don't want to talk to you.

-This one is fandom specific, but by god, if you are a DST fan who ships Wendy and Wilson, stay the absolute fuck away from me. I don't think I need to explain why shipping a 30 year old with someone who isn't even 10 yet is really gross.


If you start really bugging me, I'll probably just hide you or something. That's what the feature's for, after all!


aaand that's pretty much it. not gonna include an interests list because if i did, i'd be here for 2 hours haha
