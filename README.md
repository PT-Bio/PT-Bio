*Hello World!*

This repo is specifically made for PonyTown! If you're not from there, this won't make sense! Also, I'd prefer if this repo wasn't starred, but alas, i can't stop you if you do star it.... (it also used to be longer but i cut it in half)


--General Info--

-My pronouns are He/Him! Please refer to me with them regardless of who my character is.

-I'm very shy, and I'd usually like to be left alone. Nothin' personal, just not a very social guy. Please don't ask or beg me to be your friend.

-If my skin is a fictional character, don't go up all like "OMG IT'S [insert character here] FBHJVDNFRUJ" because I'm not the character dude :/ I'm a real ass guy and it's pretty annoying when people do that

-I feel like I need to emphasise this one: **Do not kiss or flirt with me, ever!** No exceptions! it makes me pretty uncomfortable and I will most likely immediately hide you. Please dude, I just wanna play funny pony game, not be your boyfriend, get outta here

-I'm okay with being invited to parties or roleplays as long as they're not super serious, i like a little bit of trolling in my roleplays :D


--DNI (Do Not Interact)--

-If you're homophobic, transphobic, racist, ableist, all that jazz.

-If you're only talking to start drama over something.

-If you're advertising a roleplay or something

-You're trying to date (listen the amount of times this has happened is huge and it's so weird, it's a pony game bro i don't wanna kiss)


If you start really bugging me, I'll probably just hide you or something. That's what the feature's for, after all!


aaand that's pretty much it. not gonna include an interests list because if i did, i'd be here for 2 hours haha
