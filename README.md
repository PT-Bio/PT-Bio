Hello World!

This repo is specifically made for PonyTown! If you're not from there, this won't make sense! Also, I'd prefer if this repo wasn't starred, but alas, i can't stop you if you do star it....

I'll try to make this short 'n sweet, so let's go ahead!

--General BYI (Before You Interact)--

-My pronouns are He/Him! Please refer to me with them regardless of who my character is.

-I'm very shy, so if I don't respond quickly to your message, reply with one word, or don't reply at all, that's most likely why. It's not that I'm ignoring you on purpose!

-Please don't repeatedly boop my character and demand social interaction, that's really daunting. I'd... actually prefer if I wasn't interacted with to be honest--

-If my skin is a fictional character (which most of the time it is), please don't treat me like I actually am that character. For example, if my skin was Spamton from Deltarune, don't go up all like "OMG ITS SPAMTON YOURE MY FAVOURITE CHARACTER EEEEE". It makes me really uncomfortable and it's just pretty disrespectful... (Although, I'm fine with jokes and just general messing around, I'm just saying to not harrass me about it!)

-I don't want people to use tone indicators when talking to me for multiple personal reasons, but if you want me to use them when talking to you, that's cool!

-I tend to miss when I get whisper from someone, and if I miss yours, I apologise! PT isn't very good at alerting you when whispers come honestly...

-Please don't call me any terms of endearment as it makes me uncomfortable and weirded out. Only people I know and trust can do that.

-Please, do not flirt with me in any way on here. I've had a few people do that and gonna be honest, it makes me really uncomfortable (and plus, it's PonyTown, come on...). On top of that, I'm demiromantic and don't like immediately jumping into any relationship. Don't get irritated when I tell you I'm not interested, because I'm not. why would you even flirt in the first place its a pony game--



--DNI (Do Not Interact)--

-If you're homophobic, transphobic, racist, ableist, all that jazz.

-If you're only talking to start drama over something.

-If you're advertising a roleplay or something. That's pretty annoying.

-JJBA and DSMP fandoms* (I have nothing against JoJo fans, I just don't want to interact with the fandom. I do have a lot against the DSMP fandom though, and would prefer to just stay away from that fandom, apologies.)

I can and will hide you if you wont leave me alone when I've asked you to. I don't mean to sound harsh, and I'll tell you beforehand if I do.


*JJBA standing for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and DSMP standing for Dream SMP, for the uninitiated.


Thank you for reading! You don't have to tell me if you did read this file by the way, and I'd prefer if you didn't say, but I still appreciate if you did read this nonetheless!
