Hello World!

This repo is specifically made for PonyTown! If you're not from there, this won't make sense! Also, I'd prefer if this repo wasn't starred, but alas, i can't stop you if you do star it....

I'll try to make this short 'n sweet, so let's go ahead!

--General BYI (Before You Interact)--

-My pronouns are He/Him!

-I'm very shy, so if I don't respond quickly to your message, reply with one word, or don't reply at all, that's most likely why. It's not that I'm ignoring you on purpose!

-Please don't repeatedly boop my character and demand social interaction, that's really daunting.

-If my skin is a fictional character (which most of the time it is), please don't treat me like I actually am that character. For example, if my skin was Spamton from Deltarune, don't go up all like "OMG ITS SPAMTON YOURE MY FAVOURITE CHARACTER EEEEE". It makes me really uncomfortable and it's just pretty disrespectful... (Although, I'm fine with jokes and just general messing around, I'm just saying to not harrass me about it!)

-I don't use tone indicators as I feel I don't need them, but if you want me to use them when talking to you, that's cool!

-I tend to miss when I get whisper from someone, and if I miss yours, I apologise! PT isn't very good at alerting you when whispers come honestly...


--DNI (Do Not Interact)--

-If you're homophobic, transphobic, racist, ableist, all that jazz.

-If you're only talking to start drama

-If you're gonna flirt with me or something, that's pretty weird bro (If it gets really uncomfortable and you don't stop when I ask, I'm going to hide you. No complaints!)

-JJBA and DSMP fandoms* (I have nothing against JoJo fans, I just don't want to interact with the fandom. I do have a lot against the DSMP fandom though, and would prefer to just stay away from that fandom, apologies.)


*JJBA standing for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and DSMP standing for Dream SMP, for the uninitiated.


Thank you for reading! You don't have to tell me if you did read this file by the way, and I'd prefer if you didn't, but I still appreciate if you did read this nonetheless!
